# Coherence and Information in an Optical Fibre.

This is the accompaning notebooks to go along with my Fibre Interferometry experiment. This is 1/10th of my third-year physics course at the University of Cambridge.

The experiment was concerned with observing fringes using a Mach-Zehnder interferometer using two sources, a Super Luminescent Diode (SLD) and a Fabry-Perot laser.

At first the spectra of the two sources were inferred using the contrast of fringes created by modulating the signal with a ramp function is one arm of the interferometer. The analysis of which was completed using Fourier analysis (via FFT) using the `scipy` module (see https://realpython.com/python-scipy-fft/). 

After this, there was investigation into how an amplifier would affect the contrast of the fringes. This proved more of a pratical than a theoretical challenge.

Finally, we carried out velocity detection using the same principle on a setup with a loudspeaker (conntected to a function generator) with a mirror attached.

Overall, it was a great experiment with good support from lab techs and lecturers.
